### This is a demo showcasing how to approach integration testing using [Cypress](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress) and [cypress-autorecord](https://github.com/Nanciee/cypress-autorecord). It uses the [angular-realworld-example-app](https://github.com/gothinkster/angular-realworld-example-app) as the dummy application.

Navigate to `cypress/` folder to find the integration test.

To see the tests in actions run `yarn start` and then `yarn cypress`.
